# Tetris-Pygame
Made my 1st game via **pygame**!

## Module-Required
Just go to cmd as an admin and dupe this line: <br>
pip intstall pygame 

## CodeInYourFavLang
My favourite programming language is **Python**! <br>
Hence, made use **Python** to build this game, as it really easy to understand and manipulate. It's not that hard, trust me.

##  ConceptsForTheGame-That-I-Made 
1. Random
2. OOPs
3. Matrix
4. Pygame

### Updates
Further Changes will be done soon to make the game look more efficient. Any developer who wants to contribute feel free to reach out. <br>
Thanks! <br>
